A digital cheatsheet to cheat during tests. Also uses AI if you have internet.

## AI KEYBINDS

You will need a gemini api key! if you dont have this just disable all related code yourself.

+ Right: Asks AI with the content you have copied in clipboard.
+ 0: Sends a screenshot of your screen to AI to analyze for questions.
+ 9: Changes Gemini AI model


## REGULAR KEYBINDS

+ Up: Silences all hotkeys
+ Left: Opens up a search bar to search through all notes
+ Down: Exits the program. Spam press alphabets after pressing this key. Just in case.
+ All other keys: All your notes.

## CONFIG

+ Change your "secret_messages" dict to whatever you want
+ Change your gemini api key to whatever you want. Disable all related code if you don't want this feature.
+ Alter your prompt to whatever you like. I ended up changing mine to fit MCQ questions, you can uncomment the old one if you need it.

## BUILDING
